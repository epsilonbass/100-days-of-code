# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 26,2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I have worked on some tutorials with Codeacademy and FreeCodeCamp, started Github account.

**Thoughts** I have previous experience working with HTML so the projects I am working on at the moment are pretty easy.  I know that once I get to HTML5 or CSS, things will get more difficult.  I am also learning how to use Github, and al the moment it's tricky but I am figuring stuff out.  I would like to continue on this journey.

**Link(s) to work**: Nothing here yet.
